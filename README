# SSH Connector
A script that tries to connect to a configured host directly using an IP or DNS name and a Tor hidden service.

## Requires:
### Client on Arch Linux
* A tor client setup and running, listening on port 9060 for incoming socks proxy connections.
* `tor-resolve` command that is included in the "tor" package.
* `ncat` command that is included in the "nmap" package.
* ssh
* python3 to run the script.
### Server on Arch Linux
* A tor hidden service setup and running on the same port as the SSH server.
* An SSH server.

## How to use
Setup an Arch Linux server running an SSH server with the port forwarded
  If you set up a server and change the DNS, Onion, User, and Port in the hosts array near the top, it should work. This one was just written a couple days ago as an incomplete rewrite of the bash version.
