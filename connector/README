Requires:
  tor
  tor-resolve
  printf
  ncat
  ssh
  python3


Onion | an address to a tor hidden service
DNS   | DNS or an ip address
Port  | port of ssh, and the hidden service (must be the same)

Python version:
  If you set up a server and change the DNS, Onion, User, and Port in the hosts array near the top, it should work. This one was just written a couple days ago as an incomplete rewrite of the bash version.

Bash version:
  This one is 6 months old. It should also work if you change the dns, onion, and root at line 39 in connect_commented.sh
